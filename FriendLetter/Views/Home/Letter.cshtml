  <h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
  <p>Dear @Model.Recipient,</p>
  <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in Iceland while I learn programming! </p>
  <p>@Model.Recipient, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
  <p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
  <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Travel Enthusiast @Model.Sender</p>
